Remotely Connecting:
If you have Windows install Git and put it into VS code, if you have MAC you don't have to do anything. 
Open up terminal in VS code and input this: $ ssh cs15lsp23zz@ieng6.ucsd.edu. 
Make sure you don't include $, it is only for convention and replzce the zz with your specific account letters.
You will get a message saying, "The authenticity of host..." type yes and then enter your password.
